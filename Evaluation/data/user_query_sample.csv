The criterion for calculating \ncompensation for damage or loss may be based on the original purchase price of \nthe device. \nInternational \ntravel: \nSubject to the Warsaw Convention, the maximum liability for \nthe delay, damage, or loss is $9.07/lb. for checked baggage and approximately \n$400 per guestfor unchecked baggage.
